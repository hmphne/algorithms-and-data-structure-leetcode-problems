# 🧠 LeetCode Practice with NeetCode — Data Structures & Algorithms

Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository! This repo tracks my progress as I work through the **[NeetCode DSA Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/)** to improve my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.

## 💡 Why I'm Doing This

As a software developer, I believe that strong problem-solving skills are key to growing in the tech industry. I'm tackling this challenge to:

- Strengthen my grasp of core data structures and algorithms
- Improve my coding speed and clarity
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Build long-term problem-solving confidence

## 🗺️ Roadmap

I’m following NeetCode’s structured path which covers essential DSA topics like:

- Arrays & Hashing
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Stack / Monotonic Stack
- Binary Search
- Trees / Binary Trees
- Heaps / Priority Queue
- Backtracking
- Graphs (DFS/BFS)
- Dynamic Programming
- And more...

Each topic contains multiple LeetCode problems that increase in difficulty from Easy → Medium → Hard.

## 📁 Folder Structure


Each file includes:
- Problem description link
- My implementation
- Time & space complexity
- Optional notes or thoughts

## 🚀 Progress

*(Updated weekly)*

## 🛠️ Technologies

- JavaScript (main)
- Occasionally Python for comparison
- VS Code

## ✍️ Notes to Self

- Write clean, readable code
- Aim for optimal time & space complexity
- If stuck, analyze the solution and retry from scratch later
